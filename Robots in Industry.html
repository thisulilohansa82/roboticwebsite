    <h2>Collaborative Robots (Cobots)</h2>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Collaborative robots, commonly known as cobots, are designed to work alongside human operators in a
                shared
                workspace. Unlike traditional industrial robots that operate in isolated environments, cobots are
                equipped
                with advanced sensors and safety features that allow them to interact safely with humans. Key
                advancements
                in cobots include:

                Enhanced Safety Features: Cobots are built with force-limiting technology and compliant joints to
                prevent
                injuries during human-robot interactions.

                Ease of Programming: Modern cobots feature intuitive programming interfaces, enabling users to teach
                tasks
                through direct interaction without the need for extensive coding knowledge.

                Flexibility and Adaptability: Cobots can be easily reprogrammed and redeployed for different tasks,
                making
                them ideal for small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) seeking versatile automation solutions.

        <h2> Integration with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) </h2>
        <li>
            <p>The integration of AI and ML into industrial robots has significantly enhanced their capabilities, enabling
                smarter and more autonomous operations. Key advancements include:
    
                Predictive Maintenance: AI algorithms analyze data from robot sensors to predict potential failures,
                allowing for timely maintenance and reducing downtime.
    
                Quality Control: Machine learning models enable robots to detect defects and inconsistencies in products
                with higher accuracy, ensuring superior quality standards.
    
                Adaptive Manufacturing: AI-driven robots can adjust their operations in real-time based on changing
                production requirements, improving efficiency and reducing waste.</p>
