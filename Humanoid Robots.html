        <h1>Humanoid Robots: Overview of Humanoid Robots and Their Capabilities</h1>
    </center>

    <p>
    <h3>

        Humanoid robots, designed to mirror the human form and movement, represent one of the most fascinating and
        rapidly advancing areas within the field of robotics. These robots are engineered to perform tasks in
        environments designed for humans, leveraging their human-like structure to interact seamlessly with the world
        around them. This section provides a comprehensive overview of humanoid robots, exploring their design,
        capabilities, applications, technological components, challenges, and future prospects. <br><br>

        <h2>1. Introduction to Humanoid Robots</h2>

        Humanoid robots are robotic systems that resemble the human body in structure, including a torso, a head, two
        arms, and two legs. Unlike other types of robots that may be designed for specific industrial or service tasks,
        humanoid robots are built to navigate spaces designed for humans and perform a variety of tasks that require
        human-like dexterity and interaction. The primary objective behind developing humanoid robots is to create
        machines that can assist humans in everyday activities, work alongside them in industrial settings, and even
        serve as companions.</h3>
